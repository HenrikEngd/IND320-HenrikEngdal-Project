    "### AI Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "AI plays a multifaceted role throughout this project, primarily serving as an assistant and analytical tool. The project leverages AI in several areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Development and Code Generation:** \n",
    "- AI assists in writing and optimizing code for the application. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analysis and Insights:** \n",
    "- AI helps analyze data patterns and identifying trends. It assists in generating meaningful statistical summaries and suggesting appropriate visualization techniques for the given data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation and Communication:** \n",
    "- AI supports the creation of clear documentation, such as code comments, and user interface text. It helps structure the project documentation and ensures technical concepts are communicated effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem-Solving and Debugging:** \n",
    "- Throughout the development process, AI serves as a coding companion, helping troubleshoot issues, optimize data processing workflows, and suggesting best practices."

The file streamlit_app.py also includes code for loading, preparing and caching the data so that its available to the other pages. Being done this way, a user has to enter the homepage before data is possible to display, but since it's the \"landingpage\" i think thats fine, and i've also added some error-handlig that politely asks the user to navigate back if the data is not loaded yet. \n",
